The goal of this data was to describe and show the average test scores and passing rates that a charter and district schools have to offer.
Two main take aways we can draw from the data is that charter schools out performed slightly than district schools who had more of a budget per student than the other.
While charter even though have less funding per student in the budget had more passing rates and higher test scores than that of district schools.
Only thing that I could see that they shared something close to similar was that of reading scores. Each are very close to average reading scores showing 
that even though charter outperforms across the board they do share one thing in common.
